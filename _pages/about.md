About Me
=====
I am a PhD Research Fellow in Data Science at the University of Oslo (UiO), Norway, advised by [Dr. Ingrid Chieh Yu](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/people/aca/ingridcy/) (Associate Professor, UiO) and [Dr. Aida Omerovic](https://www.nr.no/en/user-info?query=aida) (Research Director, Norsk Regnesentral). As a member of the Center for Scalable Data Access (SIRIUS), I do research on Explainable AI (XAI). My research involves interpreting, debugging, and validating black-box machine learning models. I am deeply excited about making AI decision systems explainable, transparent, and accountable. 

I received my M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence from Qazvin Islamic Azad University (QIAU), Iran, in 2016, where I worked on data clustering under the supervision of [Dr. Mohammad Reza Meybodi](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/~meybodi/) (Professor, Amirkabir University of Technology). In 2012, I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Software Technology from Islamic Azad University, Mahabad Branch, Iran.
