I am a PhD Research Fellow in Data Science at the University of Oslo (UiO), advised by Dr. Ingrid Chieh Yu (Associate Professor, UiO) and Dr. Aida Omerovic (Research Director, Norsk Regnesentral). As a member of the Data Science research program at the Center for Scalable Data Access (SIRIUS), I do research on eXplainable AI (XAI). I am excited about making black-box machine learning models explainable, transparent, and accountable. My research interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Optimization, eXplainable AI, and Interpretability.
