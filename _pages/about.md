About Me
=====
As a full-stack data scientist, I thrive on leveraging AI to solve complex challenges across various industries like energy, finance, and healthcare. My expertise spans Explainable AI (XAI), Machine Learning (ML), Large Language Models (LLMs), data engineering, and MLOps, all with a focus on developing innovative, reliable, and explainable solutions that align with business objectives and create tangible value.

I am dedicated to building trustworthy ML models, integrating explainability to ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards while fostering greater confidence in AI-driven insights. From cloud-based data pipelines and model development to seamless production deployment, I turn cutting-edge technologies into actionable, user-centric solutions.

Collaboration and agile development are at the heart of my approach. I apply agile methodologies and cultivate cross-functional teamwork to deliver timely and impactful solutions. I mentor junior and intern data scientists, guiding their technical growth and commitment to best practices. With a strong emphasis on both innovation and communication, I aim to create AI systems that not only solve problems but drive meaningful change in people's lives.

Before my industrial adventure, I completed my PhD in Computer Science in 2022 at the University of Oslo, Norway, with a focus on XAI. In my PhD research, I immersed myself in the nuances of interpreting and improving black-box ML models like Deep Neural Networks. Through this journey, I grasped the vital importance of XAI in building AI systems that are safe, fair, transparent, and accountable â€” a foundation for the ethical and responsible application of AI in both societal and industrial settings. Before this, I obtained my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence in 2016 from Qazvin Islamic Azad University, Iran, where I researched graphical models and various areas of computer vision. Prior to that, I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Software Technology Engineering in 2012 from Mahabad Islamic Azad University, Iran, and my A.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering in 2010 from Urmia Technical and Vocational University, Iran.

If you share an interest in ML and XAI, whether practical application in industry or research exploration, feel free to drop me an email or reach out on LinkedIn.
