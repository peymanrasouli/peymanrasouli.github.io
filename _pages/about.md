About Me
=====
I am passionate about advancing healthcare through AI, particularly in the development of vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases. My focus is on building reliable, explainable, and innovative machine learning (ML) models that address complex healthcare challenges and enhance decision-making in high-stakes applications.

By integrating data science techniques with a deep understanding of user behavior and business objectives, I help build ML solutions that are user-centric and aligned with performance goals. I manage and lead explainability projects that apply XAI technologies to ML models, ensuring they comply with AI regulations and standards while increasing their trustworthiness and wider adoption in the healthcare industry.

Staying at the forefront of AI developments allows me to identify strategic opportunities that drive innovation. I place a strong emphasis on collaboration and agile practices to deliver timely, effective solutions. I believe that the power of teamwork and diverse perspectives help to create truly impactful products in the healthcare space.

Before my industrial adventure, I completed my PhD in Computer Science in 2022 at the University of Oslo, Norway, with a focus on XAI. In my PhD research, I immersed myself in the nuances of interpreting and improving black-box ML models like Deep Neural Networks. Through this journey, I grasped the vital importance of XAI in building AI systems that are safe, fair, transparent, and accountable â€” a foundation for the ethical and responsible application of AI in both societal and industrial settings. Before this, I obtained my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence in 2016 from Qazvin Islamic Azad University, Iran, where I researched graphical models and various areas of computer vision. Prior to that, I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Software Technology Engineering in 2012 from Mahabad Islamic Azad University, Iran, and my A.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering in 2010 from Urmia Technical and Vocational University, Iran.

If you share an interest in ML and XAI, whether practical application in industry or research exploration, feel free to drop me an email or reach out on LinkedIn.
