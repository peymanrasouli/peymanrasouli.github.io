About Me
=====
As a Senior Full-stack Data Scientist, I specialize in developing innovative and trustworthy AI solutions aligned with business objectives across various domains such as energy and healthcare. My core expertise lies in data science and XAI, complemented by hands-on experience with LLMs, data engineering, and MLOps, allowing me to engage in the entire AI lifecycle, collaborate seamlessly with team members, and contribute to diverse projects across the organization.

I focus on developing explainable AI solutions that meet regulatory standards and build user trust in their predictions. My approach emphasizes collaboration and agile development, fostering teamwork to deliver technically sound and timely solutions that align with organizational objectives. My mission is to lead transformative AI innovations that solve complex problems, inspire collaboration and learning, and create a profound impact on businesses and the people they serve.

Before my industrial adventure, I completed my PhD in Computer Science in 2022 at the University of Oslo, Norway, with a focus on XAI. In my PhD research, I immersed myself in the nuances of interpreting and improving black-box ML models like Deep Neural Networks. Through this journey, I grasped the vital importance of XAI in building AI systems that are safe, fair, transparent, and accountable â€” a foundation for the ethical and responsible application of AI in both societal and industrial settings. Before this, I obtained my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence in 2016 from Qazvin Islamic Azad University, Iran, where I researched graphical models and various areas of computer vision. Prior to that, I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Software Technology Engineering in 2012 from Mahabad Islamic Azad University, Iran, and my A.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering in 2010 from Urmia Technical and Vocational University, Iran.

If you share an interest in ML and XAI, whether practical application in industry or research exploration, feel free to drop me an email or reach out on LinkedIn.
