About Me
=====
I am deeply passionate about the world of AI, a field in which I have cultivated a unique blend of theoretical insights and practical experience, particularly in Machine Learning (ML) and Explainable AI (XAI). This passion fuels my analytical skills and problem-solving approach, prompting me to consistently seek solutions that are both innovative and effective. An intrinsic part of my professional journey is fostering communication and collaboration; I genuinely thrive on engaging with individuals from diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise. I believe that such interactions pave the way for richer insights and breakthrough solutions. 

I am currently a senior data scientist at Sopra Steria, Norway, designing and implementing efficient, robust, and cost-effective big data and ML solutions for various domains, including energy, finance, and IT. My work frequently harnesses the power of ML and XAI to enhance business adaptability, provide pivotal insights, and support informed decision-making based on domain data. At the core of my professional approach is a commitment to engineering solutions that are not only efficient and robust but also transparent and interpretable, ensuring that stakeholders can make informed decisions with confidence and understand the underlying mechanisms driving those solutions. Backing my work is a solid foundation of long-standing programming skills and hands-on expertise with data wrangling and visualization tools, ML development frameworks, big data technologies, and cloud-based web services.

Before my current role, I completed my PhD in Computer Science in 2023 at the University of Oslo, Norway, with a focus on XAI. In my PhD research, I immersed myself in the nuances of interpreting and improving black-box ML models like Deep Neural Networks. Through this journey, I grasped the vital importance of XAI in building AI systems that are safe, fair, transparent, and accountable â€” a foundation for the ethical and responsible application of AI in both societal and industrial settings. Before this, I obtained my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence in 2016 from Qazvin Islamic Azad University (QIAU), Iran, where I conducted research on graphical models and various areas of computer vision. Prior to that, I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Software Technology Engineering in 2012 from Islamic Azad University, Mahabad Branch, Iran.

If you share an interest in XAI, whether practical application in industry or research exploration, I would be happy to connect. Feel free to drop me an email or reach out on LinkedIn.
