About Me
=====
I am deeply passionate about the world of AI, a field in which I have cultivated a unique blend of theoretical insights and practical experience, particularly in Machine Learning (ML) and Explainable AI (XAI). This passion fuels my analytical skills and problem-solving approach, prompting me to consistently seek solutions that are both innovative and effective. An intrinsic part of my professional journey is fostering communication and collaboration; I genuinely thrive on engaging with individuals from diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise; I believe that such interactions pave the way for richer insights and breakthrough solutions. 

Currently, I am a Senior Data Scientist at Sopra Steria in Oslo, Norway, designing and implementing data and ML solutions for diverse clients spanning the public and private sectors, including industries like energy, finance, and IT. My work frequently harnesses the power of ML and XAI to extract actionable business insights from various data types—be it tabular, text, or image. At the core of my professional approach is a commitment to engineering solutions that are not only robust and high-quality but also easily interpretable, ensuring that the ML models I develop are both effective and transparent. Backing my work is a solid foundation of long-standing programming skills and hands-on expertise with data wrangling and visualization tools, ML development frameworks, big data technologies, and cloud-based web services.

In 2023, I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the SIRIUS Research Center at the University of Oslo, with a focus on XAI. In my PhD research, I immersed myself in the nuances of interpreting and improving complex ML models like Deep Neural Networks. Through this journey, I grasped the vital importance of XAI in building AI systems that are safe, fair, transparent, and accountable — a foundation for the ethical and responsible application of AI in both societal and industrial settings. Before this, I obtained my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence in 2016 from Qazvin Islamic Azad University (QIAU), Iran, and my B.Sc. in Computer Software Technology Engineering in 2012 from Islamic Azad University, Mahabad Branch, Iran.

If you share an interest in XAI, whether it is about its practical application in industry or research exploration, I would be happy to connect. Feel free to drop me an email or reach out on LinkedIn.
