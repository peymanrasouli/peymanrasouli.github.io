About Me
=====
As a Senior Full-stack Data Scientist, I specialize in developing innovative AI solutions across various domains (e.g., energy and healthcare) that are explainable, reliable, and aligned with business objectives. My expertise spans Explainable AI (XAI), Machine Learning (ML), Large Language Models (LLMs), data engineering, and MLOps, with a focus on delivering actionable insights and driving measurable impact through user-centric solutions.

I thrive on building trustworthy AI systems by integrating explainability into models to ensure compliance with industry standards and enhance user confidence. From designing scalable data pipelines to deploying production-ready models, I turn cutting-edge technologies into impactful solutions that solve real-world challenges.

Collaboration, mentorship, and agile development are central to my approach. By fostering cross-functional teamwork and guiding junior data scientists, I ensure technical excellence, timely delivery, and alignment with organizational goals. My mission is to lead transformative AI innovations that solve complex problems, inspire collaboration and learning, and create a profound impact on businesses and the people they serve.

Before my industrial adventure, I completed my PhD in Computer Science in 2022 at the University of Oslo, Norway, with a focus on XAI. In my PhD research, I immersed myself in the nuances of interpreting and improving black-box ML models like Deep Neural Networks. Through this journey, I grasped the vital importance of XAI in building AI systems that are safe, fair, transparent, and accountable â€” a foundation for the ethical and responsible application of AI in both societal and industrial settings. Before this, I obtained my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence in 2016 from Qazvin Islamic Azad University, Iran, where I researched graphical models and various areas of computer vision. Prior to that, I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Software Technology Engineering in 2012 from Mahabad Islamic Azad University, Iran, and my A.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering in 2010 from Urmia Technical and Vocational University, Iran.

If you share an interest in ML and XAI, whether practical application in industry or research exploration, feel free to drop me an email or reach out on LinkedIn.
